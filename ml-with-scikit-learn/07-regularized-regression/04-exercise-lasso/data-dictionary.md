# regression-measurements.csv

## Dataset in the editor

`regression-measurements.csv` contains **100 fixed synthetic rows**. The supplied code reads the real CSV with `pd.read_csv`, then selects feature columns and the separate target. These are dimensionless teaching measurements, not observed HomeHurray sales, prices or customer outcomes. No values are missing.

| Columns | Type / unit | Availability and role |
|---|---|---|
| feature_1, feature_2, feature_3, feature_4, feature_5 | float, dimensionless | measured before label assignment; predictors |
| target_value | float, arbitrary target units | assigned after features; target only |

The CSV row position preserves the original fixture order. It is not a predictor or entity ID. The supplied split uses that same row order and seed as the worked example. The target must never appear in X. `float_precision="round_trip"` preserves saved numeric precision; file loading is supplied setup, not another task.
